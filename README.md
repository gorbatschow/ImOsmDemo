# ImOsmWidgetDemo

This is an application for demonstrate possibilities of ![ImOsmWidget](git@github.com:gorbatschow/ImPlotOSM.git).
It is based on ![ImProject](https://github.com/gorbatschow/ImProject) template.

In short I use ImGui with GLFW backend, ImPlot, CURL and STB libraries to display interactive map using tiles provided by OpenStreetMap.

## Ubuntu dependencies

Probably you have to install the following packages for ImGui with GLFW backend
```
sudo apt install -y libx11-dev libxrandr-dev libxinerama-dev libxcursor-dev libxi-dev freeglut3-dev
```
and of course you will need CURL
```
sudo apt install curl
```
